### The existing social problem in brief
> So many people are dying or suffering in this Pandemic due to failure at lead  generation. We are not able to view and solve our doubts and get confused under certain compelling circumstances in this Covid Pandemic. We need to get a portal that helps and manages all these things in the easiest way possible

### Review of present systems to encounter the problem
> All the present systems use a system that is hard to break further to analyze and shows filtered data only.

### Shortcomings of the existing systems
> Due to availability of filtered data systems only, any supplier or NGOs is unable to see the whole data that is supplied in the portal.

### Status of the data available on the internet for a similar project
> We collect data from the user only. And for building the website resources, we collected data from MHRD, Indian Govt. Covid Helpline and WHO. For State, District and City dynamic dropdown data, we collected the Data from the Local Directory Website for Indian States.

### Technical skill required for developing such a system
> Tech Stacks Used:
  - **FrontEnd:** HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, SCSS, Streamlit, JQuery
  - **Backend:** Streamlit, Python, PHP, Heroku-CLI, Ajax
  - **Database:** JSON, Gspread-dataframe, Openpyxl, Gspread
  - **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VSCode
  - **API:** Google Drive API, Google Sheet API, Twitter API
  - **Skills:** Software Development, Web Scraping, Python Web Scripting, FrontEnd, Responsive Design Building

### Resources required for your proposed project
> Medical Data, User resources
> Domain, Server, Streamlit Web Server Host Setup

### Conclusion
> This is the Portal for all the Data Resources. These resources are filled by general people. Verification at utmost level is not guaranteed. So, we are constantly trying to improve the data system and gather more knowledge in Data Mining.
